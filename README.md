- 👋 Hi, I’m @UtahGooner
- 👀 I’m a full-stack developer for Chums, Inc (an outdoor industry small business) interested in making my development environment a better place.
- 🎧 I listen to progressive rock and metal, primary source: https://progulus.com
- ⚽ I follow The Arsenal and Real Salt Lake (for my local club) and name my dogs after previous Arsenal players/themes: currently __Rocky__ ("Rocky Rocastle", a black and white Border Collie) and __Tori__ ("Victoria Concordia Crescit", a red Border Collie).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Navajo language and about the Southern Paiute culture.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
